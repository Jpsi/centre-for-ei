<p>We believe that a basic practical knowledge of Emotional Intelligence (EI) is essential for individual happiness, outstanding teamwork, and fundamentally, a fairer society.</p>
<p>Our goals are to:
<ul>
  <li>organise practical and accessible classes on EI led by thought leaders who are passionate about understanding human emotions</li>
  <li>build a tested, structured, and teachable curriculum of EI technique</li>
  <li>connect with people/organisations who recognise the global importance and value of EI education</li>
</ul></p>
<p>We are looking for people who share this vision. If you are one of them, feel free to get in touch at <a href="mailto:connect@centreforei.com">connect@centreforei.com</a></p>
